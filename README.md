Customer Segmentation using KMeans and PCA

The fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) business data set I am using contains information of about 2000 people from a giving area patronizing the business in question. The information in the data summarizes the description of the kind of customers entering a physical FMCG store and all data has been collected through the 'loyalty card' they used. At the end of this notebook you will discover that I have been able to apply the KMeans++ algorithm and Principal Component Analysis to detect similar qualities among the different customers and separated the customers into different 'social groups' (which I have refered to here as segments or clusters)
